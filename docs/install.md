# Installation

## Nextflow

From [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) web page

```
cd adagio/bin
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

## Tempo

Currently using a forked version of the `develop` branch of [Tempo](http://github.com/mskcc/tempo). You can find that here:

```
git clone https://github.com/soccin/tempo
```

But if you cloned with `--recurse-submodules` then you do not need to clone it separately.
