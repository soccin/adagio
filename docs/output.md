# BIC Variant Pipeline (v2.3.7)

## Introduction

The output consists of the raw output files from the TEMPO pipeline along with some simple post-processing of the mutation tables to filter for non-silent events.

## Tempo Output

The core output is from the [Tempo](https://github.com/mskcc/tempo) research pipeline from MSKCC CMO Computational Science group. The raw output from Tempo is in the `tempo` subfolder, and a detailed description of these files can be found here: [Tempo-Outputs](https://deploy-preview-983--cmotempo.netlify.app/outputs.html). _N.B._, to save space, the `bam` and `snp-pileup` files are not delivered by default. If you require them, please contact us.


## Post folder

The post folder contains a number of useful files that give an overall summary of the pipeline and results.


### Reports

The reports folder contains multiple files providing comprehensive analysis results:

#### SNV Report (`{projectNum}_SNV_Report01_v2.xlsx`)
The SNV (Single Nucleotide Variant) mutation summary report in Excel format with the following three sheets:

1. *Sample Data*: Provides summary information on samples including TMB and sample purity.
2. *Gene Stats*: Lists genes mutated in more than two samples, with mutation count, frequency, and affected samples.
3. *Mutations*: Displays a table of all non-silent mutations detected.

#### FACETS Report (`Proj_{projectNum}_facets_v3.xlsx`)
A comprehensive Excel report focused on copy number analysis results from FACETS, including sample purity estimates, ploidy information, and copy number profiles.

#### Segmentation Files
- `Proj_{projectNum}_Filtered_facets_hisens.seg`: High sensitivity segmentation data from FACETS analysis
- `Proj_{projectNum}_Filtered_facets_purity.seg`: Purity-based filtered segmentation data from FACETS analysis

These tab-delimited files contain genomic coordinates and copy number segment information for downstream analysis.


### Pipeline Info

The pipeline_info folder contains comprehensive information about the pipeline execution:

- `version.txt`: Details about the software version, timestamp, git repository information, and assay type used for analysis
- `output.html`: HTML version of this output documentation


### Plots Folder

The plots folder contains copy number profile plots generated by FACET for each sample, providing convenient access to visual representations of copy number alterations.
